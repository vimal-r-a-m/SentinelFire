🔥 Multispectral Wildfire Risk Assessment
A Weakly Supervised, ML-First Verification System

This project investigates whether spatial–spectral learning using Sentinel-2 imagery can improve second-stage verification and prioritization of coarse wildfire alerts generated by MODIS, under weak supervision.

Rather than predicting ignition or burn severity, the system is explicitly designed to refine, rank, and correct coarse alerts in a cost-aware and production-realistic manner.

📌 Key Idea (One Sentence)

Given a MODIS fire alert, can high-resolution multispectral learning better assess how risky that alert looks compared to simple spectral rules?

🚨 What This Project Is — and Is Not
✅ This project does

Treat MODIS fire alerts as weak supervision

Evaluate spatial–spectral CNNs as second-stage verifiers

Compare ML against rule-based NBR heuristics

Perform ablation and disagreement analysis

Emphasize ranking, recall, and robustness

❌ This project does NOT

Predict future wildfire ignition

Estimate burn severity (no dNBR)

Replace MODIS detection

Claim pixel-level ground truth

Optimize for accuracy or F1 score

🗂 Dataset

We use the Sen2Fire benchmark dataset:

Input: Sentinel-2 multispectral patches (512×512, 10 m)

Bands:

Sentinel-2: B1–B12

Optional Sentinel-5P aerosol index

Labels: MODIS MOD14A1 V6.1 daily fire product

Splits (geographically disjoint):

Train: scene1, scene2

Validation: scene3

Test: scene4

This split prevents spatial and temporal leakage.

⚠️ Weak Supervision Assumptions (Critical)

MODIS fire labels are:

Coarse (1 km resolution)

Binary

Temporally misaligned with Sentinel-2

Not pixel-accurate

As a result:

Fire occupies a small fraction of each patch

Many “false positives” may be unlabeled fires

Some “false negatives” are label noise

👉 This motivates patch-level classification and ranking-based evaluation, not pixel-level segmentation.

🧠 Problem Formulation
Task

Patch-level binary classification

“Does this MODIS-flagged region exhibit fire-like spatial–spectral evidence?”

Why patch-level?

Matches label fidelity

Avoids circular refinement

Aligns with MODIS semantics

🧪 Baselines and Models
Rule-Based Baseline

Single-date NBR (not dNBR)

Represents common GIS heuristics

Used as a baseline comparator, not ground truth

dNBR is intentionally not used because it requires reliable pre- and post-fire imagery, which is unavailable here.

Learned Models

Spectral-only Logistic Regression
(spatially averaged bands)

Lightweight CNN (Patch-Level)

Conv → ReLU → Pool
Conv → ReLU → Global Average Pool → Linear


Why this architecture?

Minimal capacity → avoids fitting label noise

Convolution → captures local spatial patterns

Global average pooling → aligns with coarse supervision

Patch-level output → matches MODIS semantics

📊 Metrics (and Why)
Primary Metric: AUROC

Threshold-independent

Robust to class imbalance

Appropriate for ranking / risk prioritization

Reported for interpretation:

Recall (fire) → safety-critical

Precision (fire) → diagnostic only

Explicitly not used:

Accuracy → misleading under imbalance

F1 score → unstable under weak supervision

PR-AUC → precision unreliable due to label noise

🔍 Disagreement Analysis (Core Contribution)

Rather than relying only on aggregate metrics, we analyze where models disagree:

Case	Interpretation
CNN ✔ / NBR ✘	CNN recovers fires missed by brittle index rules
CNN ✘ / NBR ✔	CNN suppresses rule-based false positives
Both ✔	Easy fire cases
Both ✘	Clear non-fire
Key findings

CNN is more robust under smoke, partial burns, and mixed land cover

NBR often triggers on bare soil or seasonal stress

Most CNN false negatives align with MODIS label sparsity

This analysis justifies where and why learning helps.

🧩 Ablation Studies

We systematically test what matters:

Ablation	Result
Spectral-only	AUROC ↓ → spatial context matters
RGB only	Weak performance
NIR + SWIR	Best AUROC (~0.83)
All bands	Performance ↓ (noise)
+ Aerosol	Recall ↑, discrimination ↓

Conclusion:
Targeted spectral selection + spatial context matters more than feature quantity.

🏗 System Design Perspective

This mirrors cascaded systems in spam filtering and fraud detection:

Rules handle easy cases

ML corrects systematic failures

Balanced performance vs cost

📈 Results Summary

CNN (NIR+SWIR): AUROC ≈ 0.83

Outperforms:

NBR thresholding

Spectral-only models

Gains come from:

Spatial context

Burn-sensitive bands

Robust ranking under noise

🧠 Key Takeaways

Learning adds value as a verifier, not a detector

Spatial context matters under weak supervision

More features ≠ better performance

Cascaded pipelines are the right deployment pattern

📌 Resume-Ready Highlights

Built a weakly supervised wildfire alert verification system using Sentinel-2 imagery and MODIS fire products, achieving AUROC ≈ 0.83 on held-out fire events.

Demonstrated that lightweight spatial CNNs using NIR–SWIR bands outperform NBR thresholding and spectral-only baselines under noisy supervision.

Performed ablation and disagreement analysis to identify where learning improves robustness over rule-based heuristics.

Proposed a cost-aware cascaded deployment strategy where ML selectively corrects rule-based failures.
